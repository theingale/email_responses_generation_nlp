# Short Email Response Generation using Deep Learning and NLP

This project is based on the research paper by Google. Paper link:- https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04870 

Reading and replying hundreads of Emails in a week is quite tedious job to do. Using Natural Language Processing
and modern Deep Learning techniques a system can be designed which can read the email texts and suggests response
relevant to the email text. The project involves development of a such a smart system and deployment of the system as
a web application on the public cloud.
